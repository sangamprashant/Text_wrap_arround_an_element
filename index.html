        I'm Prashant Srivastav, a seasoned software developer proficient in
        Java, React, JavaScript, MERN, Android, PHP, HTML, and CSS, driven by a
        passion for crafting robust web and mobile applications. Since 2022,
        I've been dedicated to expanding my technical expertise and have
        mastered a diverse range of programming languages and technologies. With
        experience in both backend and frontend development, I specialize in the
        MERN stack, Android app development, and PHP-driven server-side
        scripting. Currently, I'm actively exploring Next.js to further enhance
        my skills in building server-rendered React applications. My ultimate
        goal is to excel as a web developer, taking on challenging projects that
        push the boundaries of technology while delivering top-notch solutions
        to clients, contributing to the ever-evolving digital landscape.
